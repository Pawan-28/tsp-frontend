/**
 * Working time = every hour EXCEPT Sunday (India time). The 3-day stuck-lead timer runs on working time: it stops on Sunday, so a
 * Sunday that falls inside the window simply adds one day to the deadline.
 *
 *   addWorkingMs(startMs, durMs)   the moment `durMs` of working time after `startMs`
 *   workingMsBetween(aMs, bMs)     working time between two moments (0 when b <= a)
 *   isSunday(ms)                   is this moment inside a Sunday (IST)?
 *
 * Mirror of backend/src/utils/workingTime.js (a parity test keeps them identical).
